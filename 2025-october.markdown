**Benoît Cadorel: Hyperbolicity of projective hypersurfaces via Green-Griffiths jet differentials**
<a name="cadorel"></a>

A complex projective variety X is said to be (Brody) hyperbolic if it does not admit any entire curve, i.e. any non-constant holomorphic map starting from the complex line. The Kobayashi conjecture asserts that a generic hypersurface of high degree should be Brody hyperbolic; it is even expected that the bound on the degree should be linear in the dimension of the hypersurface. The first complete proof of this conjecture was only given by Brotbek in 2017, for hypersurfaces of very large degree. It has become clear in the last few years that an efficient way of proving hyperbolicity results for hypersurfaces is to apply jet differential techniques, via the so-called strategy of "slanted vector fields", initiated by Siu: this strategy has been refined across the years by many authors (Diverio-Merker-Rousseau, Darondeau, Brotbek, Deng, Demailly, Riedl-Yang...). Until quite recently, the best known bounds it provided were at least exponential in the dimension.

A core part of this strategy of slanted vector fields consists in picking an adequate jet space sitting above the hypersurface, before studying the base locus of a natural tautological line bundle defined on it. In the last decade, Bérczi-Kirwan have managed to construct a new jet space via techniques of non-reductive GIT, which allowed them to spectacularly improve the previously known bounds, to a polynomial in the dimension.
Actually, another candidate for this choice of jet spaces has existed for quite a long time, but seems to have been a bit overlooked in this problem: the famous Green-Griffiths jet space, studied by these two authors around 1980. As we will explain, this latter space can also be used in the strategy above, and, surprisingly enough, it again gives a polynomial bound.



**Aryaman Patel: The Hitchin morphism and the Chen-Ngô conjecture**
<a name="patel"></a>

Let X be a smooth projective variety over algebraically closed k of characteristic zero. The Hitchin morphism is a map from the moduli stack of Higgs bundles to the so-called Hitchin base, which sends a Higgs bundle to the characteristic polynomial of the Higgs field. This map is surjective when X is a curve, but for dim X>1,  it is in general not surjective. The natural question is- can we describe the image of the Hitchin morphism in the latter case?
Chen-Ngô showed that the Hitchin morphism factors through a closed subscheme of the Hitchin base, called the "spectral base", which can be described explicitly. They conjecture that the spectral base is the image of the Hitchin morphism.
We prove a stronger version of this conjecture when X satisfies some conditions.


**Wendelin Lutz: The Morrison Cone Conjecture under deformation**
<a name="lutz"></a>

Let Y be a Calabi—Yau variety. The Morrison Cone Conjecture is a fundamental conjecture in Algebraic Geometry on the geometry of the nef cone and the movable cone of Y: while these cones are usually not rational polyhedral, the cone conjecture predicts that the action of Aut(Y) on Nef(Y) admits a rational polyhedral fundamental domain, and that the action of Bir(Y) on Mov(Y) admits a rational polyhedral fundamental domain.

Even though the conjecture has been settled in special cases, it is still wide open in dimension at least 3.
We prove that if the cone conjecture holds for a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold Y, then it also holds for any smooth deformation of Y.
