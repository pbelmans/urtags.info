### Speakers, titles and abstracts

**Gianluca Pacienza: Recent progress on the Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture**

**Daniele Agostini: Coble duality for Jacobian Kummer fourfolds**
<a name="agostini"></a>

The Coble cubic of a Jacobian abelian surface A is the unique cubic which is
singular along A in its natural embedding in P^8. We show how to use this cubic to build a duality between
two birational models of the Kummer fourfold of A. Along the way, we also construct a non-natural
automorphism on the Hilbert square of A. This is joint work with Pietro Beri, Franco Giovenzana and
Angel Rios.

**Massimiliano Alessandro: On the birationality of the pluricanonical maps of some 3-folds of general type**
<a name="alessandro"></a>

In 2017 Catanese provided a representation-theory-based criterion to ensure that the canonical map phi of a smooth complex algebraic variety X of general type is birational under the assumption that there exists a Galois cover X->Y. In a joint work in progress with Christian Gleissner we adapt this criterion to 3-folds isogeneous to a product of curves via an abelian group and generalize it to pluricanonical maps. We also provide an effective construction method which leads us to explicit examples of 3-folds where phi is birational.
