### Speakers, titles and abstracts

**Gianluca Pacienza: Recent progress on the Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture**
<a name="pacienza"></a>

Many properties of a projective algebraic variety can be encoded by convex
cones, such as the ample cone and the cone of curves. This is especially useful when these cones have only finitely many edges, as happens for Fano varieties. The Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture predicts the structure of these cones, in terms of the action of groups of transformations, even for classes of varieties for which these cones may be round or have infinitely many edges.
In the talk, I will try to explain the relevance of the conjecture within the framework of the MMP, present its different variants, and give an overview of some of the most recent results. 



**Daniele Agostini: Coble duality for Jacobian Kummer fourfolds**
<a name="agostini"></a>

The Coble cubic of a Jacobian abelian surface A is the unique cubic which is
singular along A in its natural embedding in P^8. We show how to use this cubic to build a duality between
two birational models of the Kummer fourfold of A. Along the way, we also construct a non-natural
automorphism on the Hilbert square of A. This is joint work with Pietro Beri, Franco Giovenzana and
Angel Rios.

**Massimiliano Alessandro: On the birationality of the pluricanonical maps of some 3-folds of general type**
<a name="alessandro"></a>

In 2017 Catanese provided a representation-theory-based criterion to ensure that the canonical map phi of a smooth complex algebraic variety X of general type is birational under the assumption that there exists a Galois cover X->Y. In a joint work in progress with Christian Gleissner we adapt this criterion to 3-folds isogeneous to a product of curves via an abelian group and generalize it to pluricanonical maps. We also provide an effective construction method which leads us to explicit examples of 3-folds where phi is birational.
